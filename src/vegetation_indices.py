vegetation_indices.py - Vegetation Index Calculation

This module provides functions for calculating various vegetation indices from near-infrared (NIR) and red or green band images. 
These vegetation indices are commonly used in remote sensing and agriculture to assess vegetation health and vigor.

Functions:
- `ndvi(nir, r)`: Computes the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).
- `gndvi(nir, g)`: Computes the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI).
- `ndre(nir, re)`: Computes the Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE).
- `ndwi(nir, g)`: Computes the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI).

Args:
    nir (numpy.ndarray): NIR image captured by a drone or sensor.
    r (numpy.ndarray): Red or green band image captured by a drone or sensor.
    g (numpy.ndarray): Green band image captured by a drone or sensor.
    re (numpy.ndarray): Red edge band image captured by a drone or sensor.

Returns:
    numpy.ndarray: An image with computed vegetation index values.

Usage:
    import vegetation_indices

    # Example usage of NDVI calculation:
    nir_image = load_nir_image()
    red_image = load_red_image()
    ndvi_image = vegetation_indices.ndvi(nir_image, red_image)

    # Other vegetation index calculations can be performed similarly.
